# Unity FPS/TPS Game: Dynamic 3D World, Versatile Controls, and Interactive UI | Unity Learning Project
I created an immersive Unity-based shooter game with dynamic 3D environments. Players seamlessly switch between first-person and third-person perspectives while encountering menacing monsters. The user interface provides critical information, enhancing the gaming experience. By integrating pre-made assets, I achieved polished visuals.
